Description

You are given a number stored in a variable with the namenum

Find out the value obtained from the expressioni % 10, whereiconsists of all the values from 1 to the value stored innum, includingnum


Input
The first and the only line of the input contains the value stored innum


Output
Print the value obtained after doing the operation,i % 10, whereirefers to all the values from 1 to the number stored innum, including that as well

Note : Print all the values on a new line

Sample Input 1 

7
Sample Output 1

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
Hint

In the sample test case, the value stored in the variablenum = 7

All the values in the range from 1 to 7 are put in the expressioni % 10, such that

1 % 10 = 1
2 % 10 = 2
3 % 10 = 3
4 % 10 = 4
5 % 10 = 5
6 % 10 = 6
7 % 10 = 7

Therefore, the required output is

1
2
3
4
5
6
